You can include these by adding the following assembly level attributes to your app:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.Internet)]\n[assembly: UsesPermission (Android.Manifest.Permission.AccessNetworkState)]\n```\n\nIf you want to add Campaign tracking you must manually add the following element to your *AndroidManifest.xml* file, inside of the `\u003capplication\u003e` `\u003c/application\u003e` tags:\n\n```xml\n\u003cservice android:name=\"com.google.analytics.tracking.android.CampaignTrackingService\" /\u003e\n\u003creceiver android:name=\"com.google.analytics.tracking.android.CampaignTrackingReceiver\"\n          android:exported=\"true\" \u003e\n  \u003cintent-filter\u003e\n    \u003caction android:name=\"com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\" /\u003e\n  \u003c/intent-filter\u003e\n\u003c/receiver\u003e\n```\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.
